# Python_API_Challenge - What is the weather like as you approach the Equator?

## **Summary**

>A point is referenced by is longitude and latitude (http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/about-geographic-coordinate-systems.htm).

>Latitude lines run from east-west and longitude lines run from north-south - Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Latitude lines cut the Earth in half (mid-point is the Equator). Latitude lines measured in degrees start at 0 at Equator. In the Northern Hemisphere, the degree range is 0 (Equator) to 90 (North Pole). In the Southern Hemisphere, the degree range is 0 at the Equator to -90 (South Pole).

>Based upon the random sample of cities and the charts prepared in this assignment:
	1. Temps are highest at latitudes of -20 to 20 - close to the equator. This may be due to the fact that the equator receives direct light and the poles receive slanted light.
	2. Temperatures decrease as you move away from the Equator (latitude 0) and, similarly increase as you move closer to the Equator (latitude 0).
	3. I did not see a correlation between humidity, cloudiness and/or windspeed with latitude.
